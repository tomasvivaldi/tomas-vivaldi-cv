              I'm Tomas Vivaldi, a software developer with over 4 years of
              experience in the field. I have developed my expertise in a number
              of programming languages over the course of my career, including
              Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and SQL, among others.
              HavingÂ worked on a variety of projects ranging from front-end web
              development to software logic development. I take great
              satisfaction in my ability to work well with cross-functional
              teams and explain difficult technical topics to non-technical
              stakeholders. I have expertise working with customers and other
              involved parties to ensure that project goals are reached and
              expectations are exceeded from my work at both smaller start-ups
              and renowned organizations like Bosch Japan. I take part in online
              coding contests and hackathons since I'm constantly looking for
              new challenges and educational opportunities.
